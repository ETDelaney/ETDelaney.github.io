### Random facts

Trumpet player in the Stavanger Musikkorps av 1919 Wind Ensemble

Aiming to break 1 minute for the 400m; 5 minutes for the mile (1.6 km); 18 minutes for the 5k (3.1 miles); trying out triathlons for fun; but swimming is dominant sport with some tennis interspersed in there

Downhill ski speed record: 109 km/hr +/- 10 km/hr (GPS measured - so there has got to be some uncertainity in it!) - at Myrkdalen

Retired amature competitive eater ;-)
